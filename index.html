<p>
	I am a software engineer at <a href="http://www.estsoft.co.kr/default.aspx" target="_blank">ESTsoft</a>. Currently, I am located in Seoul, Korea.
</p>

<p>
	I love to learn new technologies and skills. As you can see on my resume, I have learned a lot of programming languages and various frameworks. Also, I like to spend time on increasing development productivity. For example, I have tried to improve webpack build performance and was able to speed up builds by 50%.
</p>

<p>
	I've been developing web applications using React/Redux and Spring framework at work recently. I have extensive experience in Android application development and published several applications. My area of interest is natural language processing.
</p>

<p>
	I graduated from the University of Utah with Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science in 2013.

	I would like to claim myself as a hardcore film buff. I have watched a lot of films and goes to the movie theater on a regular basis. I posts film reviews on my <a href="http://joonki.tistory.com" target="_blank">blog</a> in Korean.
